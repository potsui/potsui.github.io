They can also then share their stories and explore others online via an integrated web application. By viewing the events placed by themselves and others, young learners will become aware of how others in their community lead their lives and what places and events have shaped them.",role:"Co-Creator",link:"files/sharedstory-presentation.pdf",linkText:"VIEW PRESENTATION SLIDES",files:["sharedstory-thumbnail"]}}};function i(e){$(".subheader").children().removeClass("underline"),$(".subheader-"+e).addClass("underline")}return{toggleNav:function(){$(".navpage").toggleClass("hidden"),$(".navpage-toggle .navpage-toggle-icon").toggleClass("close")},checkHash:function(e,t){var a=window.location.hash;return a?t=a.substr(1):window.location.hash=t,t},loadProject:function(e){i(e);var t=l.projects[e],a=t.files,n=$("#projects-content");n.empty();var o='<div class="col-sm-1 col-md-1"></div><div class="col-sm-10 col-md-10">';t.title&&(o+="<br><h3>"+t.title+"</h3>"),t.description&&(o+="<p>"+t.description+"</p>"),o+='<div class="project-container"><img src="images/projects/'+e+"/"+a[0]+'.jpg" class="img-responsive">',t.link&&(o+='<a href="'+t.link+'" class="image-mask-overlay" target="_blank"><h3 class="project-overlay-title">'+t.linkText+"</h3></a>"),o+="</div>",t.role&&(o+="<p>"+t.role+"</p>"),o+="</div>",n.append(o),window.scrollTo(0,0)},loadPhotos:function(e){i(e);var t=l.photography[e].files,a=$("#photography-content");for(var n in a.empty(),t)"IMG_"==t[n].substr(0,4)?a.append('<img src="images/photography/'+e+"/"+t[n]+'.jpg" class="img-responsive">'):a.append("<br><br><p>"+t[n]+"</p>");window.scrollTo(0,0)},loadSubheader:function(e){var t=l[e],a=$(".subheader");a.empty();var n=Object.keys(t).reverse();for(var o in a.append("<p>"),n){var i=n[o],r=t[i].name,s="#"+n[o];"photography"===e?a.append('<a href="'+s+"\" class='subheader-"+i+"' onclick=\"main.loadPhotos('"+i+"')\">"+r+"</a>"):"projects"===e&&a.append('<a href="'+s+"\" class='subheader-"+i+"' onclick=\"main.loadProject('"+i+"')\">"+r+"</a>"),o!=n.length-1&&a.append(" | ")}a.append("</p>")}}}();
