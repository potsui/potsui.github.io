        <p>I'm Po, a computer science major at Stanford University, class of 2019, with interdisciplinary honors in education. My interests lie in human-computer interaction, design, education, and leveraging technology for social good.</p>
        <p>In past summers, I worked as a software engineering intern for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> and <a href="https://open.edx.org/">Open edX</a>. I also have over six years of experience tutoring and mentoring students across a variety of subjects; most notably, I coached students in computer programming, design, and entrepreneurship at <a href="https://exploringtech.org">Urban Teens Exploring Technology</a>.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy running, exploring the city, taking pictures, and occasionally writing.</p>
